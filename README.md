# Intro-to-Convolution-Neural-Networks

This goal of this repository is to discuss convolutional neural networks (CNN) and how it can be applied towards the MNIST dataset. MNIST is an introductory computer vision dataset with the goal of predicting hand written digits. Each line of code will be broken down in this README in order for clarity of thought and action. This repository will go over Normalization/Reshaping techniques, working with categorical targets, building each layer of the CNN, compiling the CNN, and finally fitting the CNN to the data.
